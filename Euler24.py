The 1st lexicographic permutation is 0123456789. It is the first of 9! = 362880 lexicographic permutations starting with "0". Then come 9! permutations starting with "1".
The first permutation starting with "2" is 2013456789 and it is the 2 * 9! = 725760th permutation overall. There are 8! = 40320 permutations starting with "21" etc. Hence the 1000000th lexicographic permutation is 2783915460.
